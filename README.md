# PHP-Management-Platform

This project consists of the implementation of an Application for Dynamic and generic Management for any company using PHP.

The application to be developed is basically a dynamic database in which users can define / evolve tables (objects) and their attributes as they wish. It allows insertion of tuples (values), and the form to insert them is generated dynamically based on the specifications of the attributes associated with each
object.

It was used a virtual machine with a Operating System that included the Apache server, with PHP, SGBD MySQL and Wordpress already installed. In this case I used Oracle VM VirtualBox with Bitnami-Wordpress to run the server. All the files were accessed using a SFTP session in WinSCP.
